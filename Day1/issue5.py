#This code prompts the user to enter a string of digits, initializes a variable "count" to 0, and then enters a loop that divides the number by 10 until the number becomes 0,
# and counts the number of times it has divided. Finally, it prints the total number of digits in the original number.


num = input("Enter your number: ")
count = 0

while int(num) != 0:
    num = int(num) // 10
    count = count + 1

print("Total digits are:", count)
