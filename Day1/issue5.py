#This code prompts the user to enter a string of digits, initializes a variable "count" to 0, and then enters a loop that divides the number by 10 until the number becomes 0,
# and counts the number of times it has divided. Finally, it prints the total number of digits in the original number.


num = int(input("Enter your number: "))
count = 0
while num != 0:
 
    num = num // 10

    count = count + 1
print("Total digits are:", count)
